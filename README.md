Practical (R) Machine Learning Project
======================================

Human activity recognition using data recorded from wearable devices
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is submitted to address the requirements of the above module, as
per the assignment 2 project briefing.

An R script corresponding to the data processing and classification training
is in the file named "project.R".

A project report is included in this GitHub repository describing the steps in
data pre-processing, classifier training and internal cross-validation, as well
as the out-of-sample test against a specially-quarantined set of 20 observations.

The publishable HTML version of this report is "Project_Report.html".

The above document was generated from the R Markdown code included as "Project_Report.Rmd".
